# Preface

## Tokenized: A Token Protocol for the Bitcoin (BSV) Network

The Tokenized protocol and platform have been developed to enable users around the world to create, issue and manage tokens of all kind using the low friction and high reliability of the Bitcoin network as their infrastructure.

This documentation package gives developers who want to use the Tokenized protocol and platform a clear and concise set of information.

The documentation package is wholly hosted within the tokenized.com domain, but more information can be found in our public Github repositories which are as follows:

### https://github.com/tokenized/smart-contract

This repository contains the source code for the Tokenized platform. This platform is written in Go.

This is an Alpha release, with more changes likely before the final version. Do not use this in production. 

### https://github.com/tokenized/specification

This repository is a reference for the Tokenized protocol structure. All definitions for message types and asset types are stored in YAML to be parsed and compiled into other languages.
All definitions are grouped by their purpose and are versioned within.

Currently supported languages are:
* Go
* Python
* Markdown

Tokenized also welcome user contributions in languages not listed here.
