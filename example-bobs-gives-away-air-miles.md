# Transferring tokens

Bob is a frequent flyer for his work and has managed to rack up 4,000,000 air miles, but cannot stand the idea of flying to a holiday destination.

His sister Dianne has never been on a plane so Bob gifts her 2,000,000 air miles to spend on her first overseas holiday.

The conditions of Bob's contract with the airline are that he may only pass his miles onto direct family members so before Dianne can receive the miles, she must register with the Airline's whitelist and establish a family tie to Bob. Bob's airline wallet won't even allow him to build a transfer action with Dianne as the receiver until this is complete.

This is done by Bob contacting the registry and supplying the necessary information about Dianne and registering her as his Family member. The registry adds an entry linking Bob and Dianne together as authorised recipients of each other's air miles.

Now that Bob and Dianne are linked by the Airline's registry, he is free to transfer Dianne his airline miles.
He does this using his mobile phone app, which now allows him to add Dianne as a recipient when he creates the transfer request.
Because there is only one contract involved, and Bob has all the details of the transaction including Dianne's receiving address, he can build, sign and send the complete transfer request without having to template anything.
