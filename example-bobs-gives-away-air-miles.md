Bob is a frequent flyer and has managed to rack up 4,000,000 air miles, but cannot stand the idea of flying to a holiday destination.

His sister Alice has never been on a plane so Bob gifts her 2,000,000 air miles to spend on her first overseas holiday.

The conditions of Bob's contract with the airline are that he may only pass his miles onto direct family members so before Alice can receive the miles, she must register with the Airline's whitelist.
