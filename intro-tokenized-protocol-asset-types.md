# Tokenized Asset Types

When a tokenized asset is created, it includes a payload that defines the metadata that are attached to that particular token or tokens. The tokenized protocol is broad enough that any type of token can be developed and created.

For the initial release of the Tokenized platform, the following 5 asset types will be available:

## 1. [COU -Coupons](../assets/cou)

Coupons represent an asset that gives the bearer a right to procure a good or service with terms that are different to those under which someone without a coupon would need to agree to. This may include a discounted price, longer warranty, free installation or any other add-on or benefit.

## 2. [LOY - Loyalty Points](../assets/loy)

Tokenized loyalty points allow a merchant or business to reward repeat customers with tokens that can later be redeemed for discounted or free goods and services. Examples include coffee tokens (buy 10 coffees, get one free), airline miles (1 point per mile flown) and more.

## 3. [MEM - Membership](../assets/mem)

A membership token is a token that is usually handed out in a quantity of one which confers upon their bearers the right to access a members only zone of a business. This might include entry to a physical location such as a gym or club, or entry to a restricted part of a website such as a forum or members only zone.

## 4. [SHC - Common Share](../assets/shc)

A common share is the base security that is issued in most IPOs and STOs. It generally has shareholder rights attached to it such as the ability to vote in ballots and to create initiatives.

## 5. [TIC - Admission Ticket](../assets/tic)

An Admission ticket is a single use token that confers upon its owner the right to enter an event. Once the ticket has been redeemed, the record of ownership remains in the users wallet similar to a 'ticket stub'. Tickets can be used for any event including arena concerts, sports events, or to buy pay per view rights to an event streamed over the internet.

## 6. [CUR - Currency](../assets/cur)

Currency represents a tokenized version of a fiat currency. This is something that is issued and controlled by a legally entitled entity as a representative token of the currency being tokenized.
