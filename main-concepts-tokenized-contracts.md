# Tokenized Contracts

Tokenized smart contracts are new way for corporations, businesses and individuals to manage the ownership and distribution of goods and services, and the division of a large asset such as a company or holding into pieces for the purposes of distributing ownership and capital raising.

A tokenized smart contract carries with it the full weight of a legal document or structure that would achieve the same thing in an off-chain environment.
There are two types of contract primarily supported by the Tokenized system:
1. Static Contracts
2. Smart Contracts

## Static Contracts

A static contract is a legal contract similar to that which one would enter into today for the undertaking of a scope of work, to enter into a non-disclosure agreement, or to manage the sale of an off-chain asset that has not been tokenized.

The Tokenized Static Contract framework simply provides an easy and low cost way for inscribing the details of these contracts onto the public ledger in a way that is immutable, carries the weight of signatures and can be upheld as a true document outlining an agreement between parties. Static Contracts require only a single action to be established and do not require a Tokenized smart contract to operate.

## Smart Contracts

A Smart Contract is a contract which is managed by a Tokenized agent using the Tokenized protocol. This is a dynamic asset allocator which can be used for the distribution and management of tokens, tickets and other types of asset using the Tokenized platform.

### Contract Parties

There are two parties involved in the creation of a tokenized smart contract. These are:

1. The issuer
2. The Smart Contract Operator

It is possible for the issuer and the smart contract operator to be the same entity, however it is expected that this will only be the case for a minority of contracts that operate using platforms based on the Tokenized protocol.

In most cases, the Issuer will make use of a smart contract agent and services provided by a third party to build and operate their smart contract. These third party providers will likely also provide the necessary legal and financial knowledge to ensure that tokens issued on their platform are done in such a way that they are valid, legal and meaningful.

For this reason, building contracts using Tokenized requires the same level of foresight and preparation as that required for the creation of a similarly structured off-chain device.

## Tokenized Smart Contract Agent

The Tokenized Smart Contract Agent is a fully autonomous agent that runs using microservices instance in a cloud system such as Amazon Lambda. The smart contract has a private key that is backed up securely and can be used to re-create a contract in the event of a loss of service.

The agent can only respond to instructions it receives as Tokenized transactions into its own wallet. All responses from the agent are sent onto the blockchain as per the order of operations needed for the action taking place.

The Tokenized Smart Contract Agent is written in Go and is fully open source. Details of the agent can be found in the [Tokenized Smart Agent Github repository](https://github.com/tokenized/specification).
