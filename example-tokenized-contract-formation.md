#Tokenized Contract Formation
A tokenized contract is formed when a token issuer presents a valid 'Contract Offer' action to a smart contract. The Smart Contract checks only that the rules of the smart contract are compliant with its logic, but the legal and regulatory aspects of dealing with the assets being created must be pre-established to ensure the contract operates within market rules.
To create a Contract Offer, the Contract Issuer must prepare an 'Offer' action that contains all of the required information such as:
* Contract name
* Governing Law
* Jurisdiction
* Contract rules, voting systems
* Detail of the issuing entity/entities including key personnel, addresses etc.

The contract does not require all of this information, but legally companies may be required to make it public, so imprinting it into the formation action that creates the smart contract is a simple and easy way to do this.
