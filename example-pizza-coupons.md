# Dominics Pizza Grand Opening

Dominic has spent the last 2 years planning for today. His restaurant fit out is complete, the mortar on his wood fired pizza ovens is dry, and his fridges are chilling the drinks.
The last thing on his list is to configure a smart contract for his membership program and a loyalty point system.
Dominic downloads the Tokenized Nexus wallet and installs it on his PC. He creates a new wallet and backs up the master key, then begins configuring his smart contract.
Dominic names his contract 'Dominic's Pizza Loyalty Program'. He has already prepared a set of terms and conditions for his contract, and has these ready in Markdown format to load into the contract. This will allow anyone using his contract to read the terms and conditions at any time.
Dominic sets the contract type to loyalty program and uploads a flier showing how the loyalty points system works as a 'Supporting Document'.
Dominic's restaurant is in London so his governing law and jurisdiction is the united Kingdom. The lease on his restaurant location is 2 years long so he sets the end of his lease as the contract expiration date. He can extend that when he extends his lease through a Contract Amendment. 
Dominic has added a copy of the flier to his website which also links to the contract document itself. He adds this into the contract as well as a link to a copy of his company logo that he has stored on the Metanet.
Dominic is the issuer of this contract so he adds his own details and those of his business to the issuer fields, as well as those of his lawyers and accountants. This is all handled as a standard Issuer Entity type.
Dominic needs the least amount of headache for this to work so he has elected to use Tokenized as the third party operator of his contract. He has been to the website and is happy with the contract hosting plan, which Nexus enables him to use very simply.
He sets the contract authorisation flags to give himself full control over the whole contract. Because there is no voting necessary for change, there are no voting systems or proposal requiremetns.
Nexus sets the contract fees up as per the Tokenized pricing structure and Dominic enters his and his businesses details into. Customers of the loyalty program will be physically in his store, so there is no need to worry about registers.

Now that Dominic has filled out all the details, he is ready to create his smart contract.

Nexus does this by generating a Contract Offer transaction which it sends to the Tokenized Platform.
