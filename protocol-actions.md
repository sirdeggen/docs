## Introduction

The following actions break down the construction of a Tokenized protocol message. The action is constructed by building a single string from each of the elements in order. Each field within the action is given a specific type, including standard types and compound types.

Each message should be prefixed with a common header data. This can be changed by issuer or operator at their discretion. See the article on [how to construct a header](#) for more details.

#### Asset Definition

This action is used by the issuer to define the properties/characteristics of the Asset (token) that it wants to create.

<a name="action-contract-offer"></a>
#### Contract Offer

Allows the Issuer to tell the smart contract what they want the details (labels, data, T&C's, etc.) of the Contract to be on-chain in a public and immutable way. The Contract Offer action 'initializes' a generic smart contract that has been spun up by either the Smart Contract Operator or the Issuer. This on-chain action allows for the positive response from the smart contract with either a Contract Formation Action or a Rejection Action.

#### Message

The message action is a general purpose communication action. 'Twitter/SMS' for Issuers/Investors/Users. The message txn can also be used for passing partially signed txns on-chain, establishing private communication channels and EDI (receipting, invoices, PO, and private offers/bids). The messages are broken down by type for easy filtering in the a user's wallet. The Message Types are listed in the Message Types table.

<a name="action-rejection"></a>
#### Rejection

Used to reject request actions that do not comply with the Contract. If money is to be returned to a User then it is used in lieu of the Settlement Action to properly account for token balances. All Issuer/User request Actions must be responded to by the Contract with an Action.  The only exception to this rule is when there is not enough fees in the first Action for the Contract response action to remain revenue neutral.  If not enough fees are attached to pay for the Contract response then the Contract will not respond.

<a name="action-transfer"></a>
#### Transfer

A Token Owner(s) Sends, Exchanges or Swaps a token(s) or Bitcoin for a token(s) or Bitcoin.  Can be as simple as sending a single token to a receiver.  Or can be as complex as many senders sending many different assets - controlled by many different smart contracts - to a number of receivers.  This action also supports atomic swaps (tokens for tokens).  Since many parties and contracts can be involved in a transfer and the corresponding settlement action, the partially signed T1 and T2 actions will need to be passed around on-chain with an M1 action, or off-chain.
