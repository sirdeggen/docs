## Introduction

The following actions break down the construction of a Tokenized protocol message. The action is constructed by building a single string from each of the elements in order. Each field within the action is given a specific type, including standard types and compound types.

Each message should be prefixed with a common header data. This can be changed by issuer or operator at their discretion. See the article on [how to construct a header](#) for more details.

<a name="action-contract-offer"></a>
#### Contract Offer

Allows the Issuer to tell the smart contract what they want the details (labels, data, T&C's, etc.) of the Contract to be on-chain in a public and immutable way. The Contract Offer action 'initializes' a generic smart contract that has been spun up by either the Smart Contract Operator or the Issuer. This on-chain action allows for the positive response from the smart contract with either a Contract Formation Action or a Rejection Action.

#### Message

The message action is a general purpose communication action. 'Twitter/SMS' for Issuers/Investors/Users. The message txn can also be used for passing partially signed txns on-chain, establishing private communication channels and EDI (receipting, invoices, PO, and private offers/bids). The messages are broken down by type for easy filtering in the a user's wallet. The Message Types are listed in the Message Types table.

<a name="action-rejection"></a>
#### Rejection

Used to reject request actions that do not comply with the Contract. If money is to be returned to a User then it is used in lieu of the Settlement Action to properly account for token balances. All Issuer/User request Actions must be responded to by the Contract with an Action.  The only exception to this rule is when there is not enough fees in the first Action for the Contract response action to remain revenue neutral.  If not enough fees are attached to pay for the Contract response then the Contract will not respond.

<a name="action-transfer"></a>
#### Transfer

A Token Owner(s) Sends, Exchanges or Swaps a token(s) or Bitcoin for a token(s) or Bitcoin.  Can be as simple as sending a single token to a receiver.  Or can be as complex as many senders sending many different assets - controlled by many different smart contracts - to a number of receivers.  This action also supports atomic swaps (tokens for tokens).  Since many parties and contracts can be involved in a transfer and the corresponding settlement action, the partially signed T1 and T2 actions will need to be passed around on-chain with an M1 action, or off-chain.

## Field Types

Each field in a protocol action are assigned with a data type. Standard scalar types have a single value, these include primitive and basic types. While compound types are made up of fields that have their own types, including nested compound types.

### Primitive Types

<table>
   <tr>
        <th style="width:15%">Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
   </tr>
    <tr><td>int</td><td>is a signed integer. <code>size</code> is the number of bits for the integer. Valid values for <code>size</code> are 8, 16, 32, 64.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>uint</td><td>is an unsigned integer. <code>size</code> is the number of bits for the integer. Valid values for <code>size</code> are 8, 16, 32, 64.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>float</td><td>is a floating point number. <code>size</code> is the number of bits for the float. Valid values for <code>size</code> are 32 and 64.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bool</td><td>is a boolean stored as 1 byte.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bin</td><td>is fixed length binary data. <code>size</code> is the length in bytes of the data.</td></tr>

            is variable length binary data.
            The data is preceded by an integer that specifies the actual length in bytes.
            <code>size</code> is the number of bits used to serialize the length in bytes of the data.
            Valid values for <code>size</code> are 8, 16, 32, and 64.
            For example, a <code>varbin</code> value with a <code>size</code> of 8 will be able to contain up to 255 bytes and will be preceded by a 1 byte unsigned integer specifying the length in bytes.

### Basic Types

<a name="type-op-return-message"></a>
##### Op Return Message

`OpReturnMessage` implements a base interface for all message types.

Provides the ability to serialize the data as a Bitcoin OP_RETURN script and to request the variable payload data.

<a name="type-payload-message"></a>
##### Payload Message

`PayloadMessage` is the interface for messages that are derived from payloads, such as asset types and message types.

Provides the ability to serialize the data.

<a name="type-tx-id"></a>
##### Tx Id

`TxId` represents a Bitcoin transaction ID.

It is the double SHA256 hash of the serialized transaction.

`size` does not need to be specified and is always 32 bytes.

<a name="type-public-key-hash"></a>
##### Public Key Hash

`PublicKeyHash` represents a Bitcoin Public Key Hash.

It is the RIPEMD160 hash of the SHA256 of the serialized public key.

Public key hashes are used as an "address" to send/receive transactions, tokens, and messages.

`size` does not need to be specified and is always 20 bytes.

<a name="type-asset-code"></a>
##### Asset Code

`AssetCode` represents a unique identifier for an asset/token.

`size` does not need to be specified and is always 32 bytes.

<a name="type-contract-code"></a>
##### Contract Code

`ContractCode` represents a unique identifier for a static contract.

The `size` does not need to be specified and is always 32 bytes.

<a name="type-timestamp"></a>
##### Timestamp

`Timestamp` represents a time. `size` does not need to be specified and is always 8 bytes.

#### Voting System

A VotingSystem defines all details of a Voting System.

        <td>Vote Type R - Relative Threshold, A - Absolute Threshold, P - Plurality,  (Relative Threshold means the number of counted votes must exceed the threshold % of total ballots cast.  Abstentations/spoiled votes do not detract from the liklihood of a vote passing as they are not included in the denominator.  Absolute Threshold requires the number of ballots counted to exceed the threshold value when compared to the total outstanding tokens.  Abstentations/spoiled votes detract from the liklihood of the vote passing.  For example, in an absolute threshold vote, if the threshold was 50% and 51% of the total outstanding tokens did not vote, then the vote cannot pass.  50% of all tokens would have had to vote for one vote option for the vote to be successful. </td>
